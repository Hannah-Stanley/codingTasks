## Description 
This project was created to practice database interaction with MongoDB and Mongoose. It is a full-stack web application, the back end created using Express and the front end created using React. I created a MongoDB that stores information about the cars in a collection called cars. 

This application allows you to:
- Add a car to the cars collection
- Update information about a single car 
- Update information about more than one car 
- Delete a specific document 
- List all the information for all cars in the database 
- List the models, make, registratio number, and current owner for all cars older than five years
